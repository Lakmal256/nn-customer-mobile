  "nN_140_4_text": "In very hot and dry periods the wind is very hot. Therefore, use fog sprays to spray fog into the air over the concrete surface and in the direction opposite to the direction the wind is blowing. Using fog sprays reduces the rate of evaporation from the concrete surface.",

  "nN_140_5_text": "Commence curing as soon as possible after finishing. Spray the surface with liquid membrane curing compound or cover the surface with wet burlap or start water curing after concrete placement once it starts its setting behaviors. An impervious sheet such as polythene, preferably white color to reflect radiation should be placed over the concrete as finishing proceeds. The sheet may require supporting initially to avoid marring the finished surface but should be lowered into close contact as soon as possible and securely fastened down to prevent wind from blowing underneath. Sheeting should be kept in place for several days.",
